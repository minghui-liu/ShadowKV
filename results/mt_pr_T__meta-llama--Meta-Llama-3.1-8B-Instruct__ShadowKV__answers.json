        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: Though Cleeve was by no means a wealthy house, the monks were able to make significant investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.\u00a01435\u201387) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.\nAbstract:\nThe armed forces in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) were initially formed in 1949 as an internal security force to assist the police during strikes and riots. However, after an attempted coup in 1962, the armed forces faced significant cuts in funding, recruitment, and joint operations, leaving them ill-prepared for a large-scale insurrection. By 1970, the armed forces had a limited budget and outdated weaponry. The Ceylon Army consisted of three infantry regiments armed mostly with World War II-era weapons. The Royal Ceylon Navy had only one frigate and a few coastal motor boats, while the Royal Ceylon Air Force had limited numbers of aircraft and mothballed jet trainers. Overall, the armed forces lacked modern weaponry, tanks, field artillery, and ammunition stocks for sustained combat operations.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 17: However, continuing legal complications in the Welles estate and a lawsuit by Welles' daughter, Beatrice Welles, caused the project to be suspended. When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his long-time companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \"blocked\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles \u2013 Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced \u2013 Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.\nAbstract:\nThis text discusses the unique status of Theseus in the cultic calendar of Athens and his representation of Athenian traits. Despite being born in Megara and being considered an outsider initially, Theseus became representative of essential Athenian qualities. It is suggested that his actions and journey to Crete came to symbolize the naval power of Athens after the Persian Wars. The text also highlights the dynamic nature of Athenian festivals, as new interpretations of founding myths can lead to new understandings of the festivals. The Pyanopsia festival, along with other Theseus-based Greek festivals, not only symbolically thanked Apollo for his actions and abundance in agriculture, but also represented the values of the founders. The text also mentions the worship of the Horae, the daughters of the goddess of divine law and order, at the Pyanopsia festival. This connection between the Horae and agriculture and vegetation is revealed through their worship at the Pyanopsia and another spring festival called the Thargelia.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 18:  Jay Nichols (Hank Azaria) is Herman's best friend, a resident writer for Waterton who works upstairs. Prior to the timeline of the series, he had helped Herman land a job as a fact checker in the research department. A smooth-talking ladies' man, Jay often is more gutsy when it comes to pursuing women, and typically, is subject to periodic rejection from women who do not tolerate his machismo and clich\u00e9d pick-up lines. He is often looked to by Herman as a level of confidence to aspire to, while Jay eventually ponders how Herman's more cautious, \"nice guy\" persona could work to his advantage. He has also made Herman feel insecure at times because of his position in the company being higher than Herman's. A frequent visitor to the research department, Jay always drops in to have spirited conversation with his best buddy, whom he always calls \"Hermo\", \"The Hermster\", or some variation thereof. Originally, Jay is exclusively seen chasing after flashy, status-conscious women, most notably Heddy Newman, who continually turns him down and gives him very little acknowledgement during his visits to the research department. He was engaged to a woman he was hopelessly in love with, but she left him at the altar\u2014which nearly destroyed him. And so he now regards relationships with women as just for sex. His ex-fianc\u00e9e returns and he falls back in love with her. He prepares to leave all of New York to go away with her, but she abandons him again. Jay pretends he left her this time, but Herman pretends he does not know that she left him. By the third season, Herman fixes up Jay with Louise Fitzer, and the two become an item. They begin to fall in love with each other.\nAbstract:\nThe text explains that cyclopropanones, which are three-membered ring ketones, undergo hydration to a significant extent. This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

The operation was divided into four districts and a new livery of cream and verona green replaced the Bradford light blue & cream, Huddersfield red & cream, Leeds two-tone green and Halifax & Calderdale orange, green & cream.

The finding attracted attention, with Cornell University scientists examining parts of the body, and over 5,000 people paying to see the \"giant.\" However, it was later revealed to be a hoax orchestrated by the hotel's owner, John Thompson, and two others. The inspiration for the hoax came from the Cardiff Giant, a similar fake discovery in Cardiff, New York in 1869. Although the original giant was damaged and lost, a replica was made in 2019 for the Tompkins Center for History & Culture.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

Often these works unsettle and challenge their audiences. She also closely aligns herself and her artistic practice with the figure of the \u201csacred clown\u201d, a Hopi Indian figure who teaches lessons in uncouth ways. As well, she bases her work on trickster figures such as Coyote and Raven, who is seen as both a prankster, but also as wise. For example, in her performance, Raven on the Colonial Fleet (2010), she \u201cwears a corset, skirt and blanket designed with reference to traditional Northwest Coast Aboriginal Art and a feathered headdress referencing the Plains cultures.\u201d Reece uses such regalia to make a political statement and to overturn Indigenous gender roles, for example by wearing a headdress that is usually reserved for men. Images of grenades, arms, and mythological figures cover her clothing to represent her as a \u201cfe/male warrior\u201d and as a mythological figure, like Raven, coming to help fight against colonial violence. In 2010, she also performed this piece at the 17th Biennale in Sydney, Australia. As well, in a 2008 performance for the National Museum of the American Indian based on an episode of the television show, Moesha, she dressed up as a nurse and asked the audience, \"Does anyone want to share any feelings you have about being a colonizer?\" She proceeded to have another artist bring out a bucket of red paint in which he begins to paint \u201cone of Columbus's ships on a large board as Reece speaks about sexual fetishes, fear of government and the inaccurate portrayal of Indians on television.\u201d Reece saw this \u201cas a metaphor for white people taking the blood of her people and painting their own history of them.\u201d One song in her album Sweetgrass and Honey was created to honor carvers like her father and the Nuu-chah-nulth carver John T.

One day, the animal disappears, and the elder sister goes looking for it. After a while, she sits by a rock near a cave. A little bird appears to her and begs for some food, and asks her to marry it. The elder sister refuses and returns home. The next day, the middle sister goes to look for the animal and rests by the same stone, and the same white bird propositions her, but she declines. Lastly, the youngest sister agrees to marry the white bird, and he directs her into the cave. Inside, magnificent and richly decorated rooms appear before her with every door she opens. At last, the little bird perches upon a couch and tells her that their buffalo was devoured by an evil raksha. The girl begins to live there as the white bird's wife, tidying the place and preparing the food. Some time later, a festival is held in a nearby village, with musicians, equestrian games, and all sorts of amusement. The white bird's wife goes to the festival, and sees a handsome youth on a gray horse, who gazes at her. The girl leaves the festival and meets an old woman. The girl pours out her woes to her, lamenting over the fact that her husband is just a little bird, but the old woman reassures her that the youth at the festival was her husband, and that she only has to burn his bird disguise the next time. The girl follows the old woman's instructions the next day, and burns the bird skin. The same night, her husband (in human form) comes home and asks her about the bird skin. The girl tells him she burned the birdskin, and the man reveals he is a prince, and that the birdskin was to protect him from an evil witch. Saying this, a whirlwind comes and takes the prince. The girl tries to find him and wanders through valleys and deserts, until she finds him one day near a temple, carrying jugs of water and wearing faded boots. The prince tells her to get feathers from all species of bird for a new bird coat, and, once she has fashioned it, she must chant a special prayer for him to return to her. Saying his, he disappears. The girl returns to their cave palace and gathers all feathers she can must, fashions a new bird skin and chants the correct chant to summon her husband back to her. He appears and both live happily.\nAbstract:\nIn this text, Pfc. Powers is recognized for his bravery and courage during a military mission in Cassino, Italy in 1944.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: Mafra wrote that Magellan's port was an isle with a circumference of 3-4 leagues or 9-12 nautical miles. \"Y otro dia luego parti\u00f3  [Magallanes]  de esta isla, y navegando su viage llego a otra isla que tendra de circuito de tres hasta cuatro leguas\". (\"And after another day he [Magellan] left this island [Homonhon], and sailing on his way arrived at another [Mazaua] three or four leagues in circumference.\") Because the shape of the isle is almost circular, 3-4 leagues translate to an area of from 2,214 up to 3,930 hectares. In contrast, Limasawa is only 698 hectares. He also stated, they anchored west of the isle: \"Esta isla tiene un puerto bueno a la parte del poniente della, y es poblada.\" (\"This island called Mazaua has a good harbor on its western side, and is inhabited\"). Mazaua is officially, by Philippine law, declared as the island of Limasawa, an isle without anchorage, and the port is located east of the island. Mafra's most clarifying testimony is that Mazaua was 15 leagues, roughly , below Butuan in 1521 which in Pigafetta's map, and text is a larger geographical conception than the present-day map. The land area starts from present day Surigao, and extends all the way to Zamboanga del Norte. Mafra writes in Spanish: \"De este Se\u00f1or de Ma\u00e7agua\" [Rajah Siaiu] \"supo Magallanes que en una provincia que se llamaba Butuan que es en la isla de Mindanao que es de la parte del norte della quince leguas de Ma\u00e7agua habia gran cantidad de oro.\"  (\"From the chief of Mazaua\" Rajah Siaiu \"Magellan learned that a province called Butuan, on the island of Mindanao, which is somewhere fifteen leagues to the north of Mazaua, possessed a large quantity of gold.\") This puts the port of Mazaua at 9\u00b0 N, the exact latitude for it by the Genoese Pilot, one of those who wrote an eyewitness document. All these information revolutionize geographical conception of Mazaua. Limasawa, which has been affirmed thrice by the Philippines' National Historical Institute, to be Mazaua is rectangular in shape, 698 hectares in area, and is reached by a track that is not drawn by any of the document. What is most telling is that Limasawa has no anchorage, As stated by the coast pilot, \"Limasawa is fringed by a narrow, steep-to reef, off which the depths are too great to afford anchorage for large vessels.\"\nAbstract:\nThe person described in the text received his education at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 17: Delano was born on November 4, 1904, in a rural agricultural based community of Okenla in what is now Ifo Local Government, Ogun State to Chief Edmund Delano, and Rebecca Delano, members of the Egba subethnic group of the Yoruba people. Okenla, also known as \u1e62uren-Okenla, was founded in 1868 by Chief John Owolatan Okenla, an Egba leader from Egba Ake area of Egbaland. After the creation of the town of Abeokuta, missionaries soon came and in 1842 he became one of the earliest converts. After a war between newly converted Egba and Egba still adhering to their traditional religion, he went and founded the Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral in 1868, and the village grew as more Christian converts flocked there. Both of Delano's parents were early converts to Christianity from the town of Abeokuta and most likely were among the groups of people that flocked to these new \"Christian satellite villages\" like Okenla and Wasinmi. The Delanos both became powerful Christian leaders in their community. His father was the leader, or Aro of the Egba Christians. Delano was one of the first Nigerians to go through the newly established western education brought by the British. He began attending the Holy Trinity School in his village in 1911 and from 1919 to 1921, he attended the infamous CMS Grammar School. He then transferred to the secondary school King's College, Lagos, graduating in 1923. Unable to afford school tuitions for a Cambridge University education, he became a clerk for the British colonial administration in Lagos, serving there until an accident in 1947. During this time he acquired his writing skills. After leaving the civil service in 1947, he began doing research and writings, before winning a scholarship to teach at the University of London and served as a teaching assistant until 1961, and taught the Yoruba language and linguistics. During this time, he wrote a Yoruba dictionary with grammar rules, the first of its type, Atum\u1ecd \u00c8d\u00e8 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 which was rejected several times until it was published in 1958. This dictionary was groundbreaking because earlier books had attempted to explain Yoruba using conventional English grammar tools, which did not work. Instead, Delano used tones and diacritics to write the language, and this model is used till this day. In 1961, he returned to Nigeria and became a radio broadcaster and newspaper correspondent, and a Christian leader, often working to mend the ties between the Yoruba Christian community and local Yoruba worshippers of the traditional religion. He also was a prominent Nigerian nationalist and wrote several books advocating for pan-Africanism, such as \"Soul of Nigeria,\" one of his first books. In an attempt to conserve Yoruba culture's continuous influence from first Arab influencers (from the Fulani invaders), and then the British, he also wrote many Yoruba history books. He was quick to judge those who often dismissed women as prominent members of ancient Yoruba government, citing the story of Moremi Ajasoro. He died on December 17, 1979, at the age of 75.\nAbstract:\nIn the month of December 2017, Mumbai City FC had several matches in the Indian Super League.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 18: Clement of Alexandria says: \"Because of the angels\". By the angels he means righteous and virtuous men. Let her be veiled then, that she may not lead them to stumble into fornication. For the real angels in heaven see her though veiled. Clement of Alexandria explicated this: \"It has also been commanded that the head should be veiled and the face covered, for it is a wicked thing for beauty to be a snare to men. Nor is it appropriate for a woman to desire to make herself conspicuous by using a purple veil.\" Tertullian explains that in his days, the women of the Corinthian church from the age of puberty onwards (unmarried and married) were practicing Christian headcovering despite the fact that non-Christians in the region did not observe this ordinance; as such, the practice of Christians was countercultural. In his deliberative treatise De virginibus velandis (\"On the Veiling of Virgins\") Tertullian argumented from scripture, natural law and Christian disclipline that from puberty virgins ought to be veiled when in public. The custom of some Carthaginian consecrated virgins not being veiled when the church gathered was sharply criticised as being contrary to the truth. This is only 150 years after the Apostle Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. He said, \"So, too, did the Corinthians themselves understand [Paul]. In fact, at this day the Corinthians do veil their virgins [and married women]. What the apostles taught, their disciples approve.\" \"Early church history bears witness that in Rome, Antioch, and Africa the custom [of wearing the head covering] became the norm [for the Church].\" The historian Cory Anderson stated that the reason for this is because the early Church understood Saint Paul's instruction to apply to the whole church. Origen of Alexandria () wrote, \"There are angels in the midst of our assembly\u2026 we have here a twofold Church, one of men, the other of angels\u2026 And since there are angels present\u2026 women, when they pray, are ordered to have a covering upon their heads because of those angels. They assist the saints and rejoice in the Church.\" In the second half of the third century, women praying with their heads covered is mentioned as church practice by St. Victorinus in his commentary of the Apocalypse of John. The early Christian Acts of Thomas, written in Syriac Aramaic, assigns Hell as the fate of women who did not wear a headcovering, stating:\nAbstract:\nSir Robert was a highly decorated and accomplished military officer.

The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use open market operations where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy. A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made. In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.\nAbstract:\nIn 2017, rhythmic gymnast Dina Averina achieved great success in various competitions.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: From 1899 to 1903, he was the commander of the 12th, then the 15th and finally the 6th Infantry Regiment. He was one of the main participants in the May Coup. He decided on the conspiracy because he believed that the dictatorship was the best for Serbia and that it should be achieved by revolution. At that time he was an infantry lieutenant colonel and commanded the 6th Infantry Regiment. Two days before the coup on 26 May 1903, a meeting of the main conspirators, commanded by Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 (Apis) was held in the apartment of Lieutenant Colonel Mihailo Naumovi\u0107, to which Mi\u0161i\u0107 did not come under the pretext that he was not on good terms with Naumovi\u0107. At that meeting, it was agreed that the coup would take place on 29 May (Old Style) or 11 June 1903 (New Style) at two o'clock after midnight. It was agreed that the main group of conspirator officers should join Mi\u0161i\u0107 at 1:55 A.M., who at that time was supposed to pass by the Officers' Home with one battalion of the 6th Regiment. At the time retired lieutenant general Aleksandar Ma\u0161in (Queen Draga's brother) entered the barracks of the 12th Regiment to take command when Mi\u0161i\u0107's battalion arrived behind the scheduled time, so the other conspirators went into risky action without his immediate support. Although Mi\u0161i\u0107 hesitated for a while at the time of departure, one of his subordinates led a company on his own, and then Mi\u0161i\u0107 started, though with some delay. At 2:00 A.M. Commander of the Palace Guard Petar \u017divkovi\u0107 opened the palace doors to the conspirators, now led by Mi\u0161i\u0107, who with his somewhat belated battalion stormed the palace and clashed with members of the Palace Guard, overcoming them. He took control of the yard and opened the gendarme gate of Petar Kosi\u0107's company. After capturing the Stari dvor, the conspirators were unable to find the king and queen at first. Because of that, Mi\u0161i\u0107 announced prematurely that King Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107 and Queen Draga had died and that Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 was the new king. In the meantime, the conspirators searched the palace and eventually found the royal couple in the early morning of 11 June 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disembowelled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second-floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure. The King was only 26 years old and Draga was 37 at the time of their death. King Alexander and Queen Draga were buried in the crypt of St. Mark's Church, Belgrade. Also killed with the royal couple were: Prime Minister Dimitrije Cincar-Markovi\u0107; Minister of the Army, Milovan S. Pavlovi\u0107, and General-Adjutant Lazar Petrovi\u0107.\nAbstract:\nThe text discusses how the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 to 1912, defined and referred to their state. The Qing identified their state as Zhongguo, meaning \"central state\" in Chinese, and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" in Manchu and \"China\" in English. They considered their lands, including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and other territories under their control, as part of China, defining it as a multi-ethnic state. After conquering Xinjiang, they incorporated it into China and celebrated the expansion of territory. The Qing rejected the notion that China only encompassed Han-populated areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of China. They used terms like \"Chinese language\" to encompass Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"people of China\" to include Han, Manchus, Mongols, and other subjects of the Qing. The Qing promoted the idea of uniting different ethnic groups, emphasizing that they were part of one family within the Qing state. They employed the phrases \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" and \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" to convey the concept of unification. The Qianlong Emperor also critiqued earlier beliefs that only Han people could be China's subjects, stating that this was not the understanding of the Qing dynasty. The term \"China\" was used in foreign communications and treaties with other states and first appeared in a Qing government document in 1689. Despite their efforts for unity, the Qing implemented different strategies for legitimizing different ethnic groups within the empire.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

Until the 1860s, Bromley Common consisted mainly of farmland and the estates of a few large landowners. The common itself was owned by the Bishops of Rochester as Lords of the Manor, but on the condition that various \u2018commoners\u2019 should be allowed to freely enjoy their privileges on it. It amounted to about 300 acres, extending irregularly along the sides of the road that formed the main route from Tunbridge Wells and Hastings to Bromley and, beyond, to London. It was a well-known and profitable haunt for highwaymen. After the common was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1826 (the Act was passed in 1821), there was some limited residential development, but this was mostly to the south of the old common, where it fanned out from the main road. A substantial number of homes had been built around Oakley Road and Princes Plain, such that in 1842 Holy Trinity Church, at the junction of Bromley Common and Oakley Road, was built to cater for the expanding population. In the northern section of the old common development was much more modest, with just a few dozen homes put up along the east side of the road.\nAbstract:\nThe Mekong giant catfish is a threatened species that is mainly found in the Mekong River. It used to inhabit a large portion of the river, but due to threats, it now only exists in small, isolated populations in the middle Mekong region. The fish congregates during the rainy season and migrates upstream to spawn. It primarily lives in the main channel of the river, but has also been found in the Tonle Sap River and Lake in Cambodia. Previously, fishers reported sightings of the fish in various tributaries of the Mekong, but now sightings are mainly limited to the main river channel and the Tonle Sap region. In Malaysia, an illegally released individual weighing 150 kg was found in the Kelantan river.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

One, Dawa, remained hidden in the jungle, but the other two showed themselves. Two of the missionaries waded into the water to greet them, but were attacked from behind by Nampa. Apparently attempting to scare him, Elliot, the first missionary to be speared, pulled out his pistol and began firing. One of these shots mildly injured Dawa, still hidden, and another grazed the missionary's attacker after he was grabbed from behind by one of the women. Accounts differ on the effect of that bullet. Missionaries interpreted the testimonies of Dawa and Dayuma to mean that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, but others, including missionary anthropologist James Yost, came to believe that his death was a result of the bullet wound.  Rachel Saint did not accept this, holding that eyewitnesses supported her position, but researcher Laura Rival, a critic of the expedition, suggests that it is now commonly believed among Huaorani that Nampa died of the wound. The other missionary in the river, Fleming, before being speared, desperately reiterated friendly overtures and asked the Huaorani why they were killing them. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors, led by Gikita, attacked the three missionaries still on the beach, spearing Saint first, then McCully as he rushed to stop them. Youderian ran to the airplane to get to the radio, but he was speared as he picked up the microphone to report the attack. The Huaorani then threw the men's bodies and their belongings in the river, and ripped the fabric from their aircraft. They then returned to their village and, anticipating retribution, burned it to the ground and fled into the jungle.\nAbstract:\nThe Mendip Engineering Company Ltd, originally known as Cutler's Green Ironworks, was a British company that supplied the army with swords during World War I. In the 19th century, they focused on repairing farm machinery and casting drain covers and road signs. By the early 20th century, the company was controlled by C.W. Harris and traded as the Mendip Engineering Company. They began producing steam lorries in 1907/8 and added petrol engine vans to their range in 1911. In 1913, W.L. Adams designed a four-cylinder engine suitable for Cyclecars, and in 1914, Harris announced the production of a Light Car entirely manufactured by the company. However, production was halted due to the outbreak of World War I. After the war, the company relocated to Bristol and was eventually acquired by Baines Manufacturing Company Ltd.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: The Stroop task, or modified Stroop task, displays different types of words (e.g., threatening and neutral) in varying colors. The participant is then asked to identify the color of the word while ignoring the actual semantic content. Increased response time to indicate the color of threat words relative to neutral words suggests an attentional bias toward such threat. The Stroop task, however, has some interpretational difficulties in addition to the lack of allowance for the measurement of spatial attention allocation. To address some of the limitations of the Stroop task, the dot probe task displays two words or pictures on a computer screen (either one at the top or left and the other on the bottom or right, respectively) and after a brief stimuli presentation, often less than 1000ms, a probe appears in the location of one of the two stimuli and participants are asked to press a button indicating the location of the probe. Different response times between target (e.g., threat) and neutral stimuli infer attentional biases to the target information with shorter response times for when the probe is in the place of the target stimuli indicating an attention bias for that type of information. In another task that examines spatial attentional allocation, the visual search task asks participants to detect a target stimulus embedded in a matrix of distractors (e.g., an angry face among several neutral or other emotional faces or vice versa). Faster detection times to find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli or slower detection times to find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer an attentional bias for such stimuli. The spatial cuing task asks participants to focus on a point located between two rectangles at which point a cue is presented, either in the form of one of the rectangles lighting up or some emotional stimuli appearing within one of the rectangles and this cue either directs attention toward or away from the actual location of the target stimuli. Participants then press a button indicating the location of the target stimuli with faster response times indicating an attention bias toward such stimuli.  In the morph task participants gradually scroll a facial photograph from the neutral expression to an emotion or from one emotion to another  and should indicate at what frame each emotion appears on the face. A recently introduced method consists of presenting dynamic faces (videoclips) and measuring verbal reaction time (into a microphone); it is more precise than previous solutions: verbal responses to six basic emotions differ in hit rates and reaction times.\nAbstract:\nThe text describes the characteristics of tall trees with deep and wide crowns, which become narrower in dense forests.

When Welles died in 1985 he had left many of his assets to his estranged widow Paola Mori, and after her own death in 1986, these were inherited by their daughter, Beatrice Welles. However, he had also left various other assets, from his house in Los Angeles to the full ownership and artistic control of all his unfinished film projects, to his long-time companion, mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar, who co-wrote and co-starred in The Other Side of the Wind. Since 1992, Beatrice Welles has claimed in various courts that under California law, she had ownership of all of Orson Welles' completed and incomplete pictures (including those which he did not own the rights of himself in his own life), and The Other Side of the Wind has been heavily affected by this litigation. The Guardian described how she \"stifled an attempt by US cable company Showtime and Oja Kodar (Welles's partner in the latter part of his life) to complete The Other Side of the Wind\", while The Daily Telegraph stated that Beatrice Welles had \"blocked\" the film. Matters have been exacerbated by much personal animosity between Oja Kodar and Beatrice Welles \u2013 Beatrice blames Kodar for causing the break-up of her parents' marriage, while Kodar blames Beatrice for attempting to block the screening or re-release of a number of her father's works, including Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight and Filming Othello. (The latter claim has been supported by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who has accused Beatrice of being solely motivated by profit in claiming royalties from these films, then settling out of court as studios have been keen to avoid costly legal battles.) A clause of Welles' will, specifying that anybody who challenges any part of Kodar's inheritance will be automatically disinherited, remains unenforced \u2013 Kodar sought to have it enforced in the 1990s, but could not afford the legal fees as the case dragged on.\nAbstract:\nIn 2010, Devi Sri Prasad (DSP) had a successful year in Tamil music.

At the Washington Street intersection, U.S. 150 leaves Illinois 8 and runs east-southeast towards Morton, while Illinois 8 runs east-northeast through unincorporated Sunnyland.\nAbstract:\nThe Charleston Rainbows, previously known as the Charleston Royals, changed their name and became affiliated with the San Diego Padres in 1985. They experienced improvements each season from 1985 to 1987, particularly in their pitching staff. In 1988, they won the Southern Division title but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. That year, their pitching staff had an impressive combined ERA of 2.07. However, starting in 1989, the team faced a streak of 11 consecutive losing seasons. In 1990, pitcher Charles Thompson even set a South Atlantic League record of 17 losses. The team rebranded as the Charleston RiverDogs in 1994 but did not manage to turn their luck around. However, in 1997, they moved to a new stadium called Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park, which helped increase their total attendance by over 100,000 fans. In the same year, the RiverDogs also began an eight-year affiliation with the Tampa Bay Rays. The team made history in 1998 by being the first professional baseball team to broadcast live video online and the first to broadcast video of their entire home season.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 17: In the impartial version of Hackenbush (the one without player specified colors), it can be thought of using nim heaps by breaking the game up into several cases: vertical, convergent, and divergent. Played exclusively with vertical stacks of line segments, also referred to as bamboo stalks, the game directly becomes Nim and can be directly analyzed as such. Divergent segments, or trees, add an additional wrinkle to the game and require use of the colon principle stating that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non-branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. This principle changes the representation of the game to the more basic version of the bamboo stalks. The last possible set of graphs that can be made are convergent ones, also known as arbitrarily rooted graphs. By using the fusion principle, we can state that all vertices on any cycle may be fused together without changing the value of the graph. Therefore, any convergent graph can also be interpreted as a simple bamboo stalk graph. By combining all three types of graphs we can add complexity to the game, without ever changing the nim sum of the game, thereby allowing the game to take the strategies of Nim.\nAbstract:\nThis text is about a wrestler named Peque\u00f1o Halc\u00f3n who joined CMLL in 2010. He became a Mini-Estrella and wore ring gear similar to his father's. He had his debut match in July 2010 and participated in a tournament for the Mini-Estrellas division as part of CMLL's bicentennial celebrations. Although he was eliminated early, he also competed in a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament where the losing team had to compete in a Lucha de Apuestas match. Peque\u00f1o Halc\u00f3n and his partner managed to protect their mask and hair in the first round but was eventually defeated and forced to unmask at a later event.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 18: He was born at Quebec in 1819 and died in 1902. After a course of classics and theology at Quebec Seminary, he was ordained in 1843. The first twenty-two years of his priesthood were devoted to parochial work, especially at Rimouski, where he greatly contributed to the foundation of the future diocesan seminary. His early taste for genealogical studies fully manifested itself after his official appointment to the Agriculture, Immigration, and Statistics Ministry,(1865). His whole time was henceforth spent in genealogical research compilation based largely on in-situ consultation of catholic parish registers throughout Quebec, the Maritime provinces, Ontario, and the old French settlements in the United States. He also twice visited Europe for the same purpose. As the result of his labours he published (1871\u201390) his , comprising seven large double column volumes of over six hundred pages: a colossal undertaking, fit for a numerous body of collaborators, which he achieved alone. Although he was unable to realize the latter part of his program entirely and many inaccuracies have crept into his work, yet on the whole it is highly reliable and almost unique. Every French Canadian by completing from contemporary registers the information supplied by this dictionary can proudly trace back his genealogy to his ancestors from old France. It has proved valuable for the discovery of canonical impediments to marriage through relationship, and has given birth to a copious genealogical literature of less comprehensiveness. In recognition of his labours the author received a prelature from Leo XIII (1887). He also published  (1868) and  (1886).\nAbstract:\nThe text discusses the career of a wrestler named Astral who competed in the Mini-Estrella division of CMLL (Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre). Astral, despite not suffering from Dwarfism, was shorter than average wrestlers. He won the Mini-Estrella division in the 2009 CMLL Bodybuilding contest and made his wrestling debut shortly after. Astral participated in various tournaments and matches, including the Torneo Bicentenario where the winner would be promoted to compete in the regular division. Astral also competed in a Ruleta de la Muerte tournament, where losing teams advanced and faced the risk of losing their masks or hair. Astral later wrestled for the vacant Distrito Federal Lightweight Championship, won his first title in a rematch, and became the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion in 2014. He successfully defended the title six times before 2017.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, in the 1460s, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1464\u20131487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest Chinese man, Wu Rui (\u5433\u745e) was selected by the Vietnamese court for castration since he was the only young man in among the thirteen and he became a eunuch at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long for nearly one fourth of a century. After years of serving the Vietnamese as a eunuch slave in the palace, he was promoted to a position with real power after the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam as military superintendent since his service in the palace was apparently valued by the Vietnamese. However the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n guard soldier D\u01b0\u01a1ng Tam tri (Yang Sanzhi) (\u694a\u4e09\u77e5) told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou after walking for 9 days through the mountains. The local ethnic minority Tusi chief Wei Chen took him into custody, overruling objections from his family who wanted to send him back to Vietnam. Vietnam found out about his escape and sent an agent to buy Wu Rui back from Wei Chen with 100 Jin in payment since they were scared that Wu Rui would reveal Vietnamese state secrets to China. Wei Chen planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese but told them the amount they were offering was too little and demanded more however before they could agree on a price, Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate Li Guangning and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the Ming palace at the Directorate of Ceremonial (silijian taijian \u53f8\u79ae\u76e3\u592a\u76e3).

This incident may be the same one where Wu Rui was captured.\nAbstract:\nThe text describes the events leading up to a failed attack during World War I. The divisional artillery focused on cutting wire while heavier guns aimed to destroy enemy strongpoints. General Haking believed that the enemy was disorganized and that the British had enough firepower to win decisively. However, the bombardment did little damage and General Haking insisted on lifting heavy guns from the front line before the attack. This decision went against advice from General Haig. Haking believed that high explosive fire would disperse British gas and wanted to give the Germans a chance to retreat. The attack was poorly planned and executed, leading to a report being sent to the Prime Minister.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

His first title of the year soon followed at the minor-ranking Antwerp Open, by making three centuries in a 4\u20131 win over Mark Selby in the final. Allen then beat Robert Milkins and Cao Yupeng both 6\u20132 in the inaugural International Championship, before being edged out 5\u20136 by Trump in the quarter-finals. Marco Fu at the UK Championship beat Allen 6\u20133. At the Masters Allen came past Mark Davis 6\u20132, but was then narrowly beaten 5\u20136 by Neil Robertson in a high-quality encounter in the quarter-finals. At the Snooker Shoot-Out, the tournament where each match is decided by a 10-minute frame, Allen won through to the final where he lost to Martin Gould. He suffered successive second round defeats at the German Masters and the Welsh Open to Barry Hawkins and Ding Junhui respectively, before he travelled to China in an attempt to defend his World Open title from 2012. Allen comfortably won every match he played at the event as he beat Ryan Day 5\u20132, Robert Milkins 5\u20132, Ricky Walden 5\u20131, John Higgins 6\u20132 and Matthew Stevens 10\u20134 in the final to capture his second ranking title.

It incorporates drum notes, including heavy beats and grooves. The song's second version features a rap version from Mobb Deep. The song samples the melody from \"Shook Ones Part II\" by Mobb Deep, incorporating it into chorus and bridge.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 16: In recent times, Eurostat publishes the \"business investment rate\" (also called the \"gross investment rate of non-financial corporations\") in its quarterly sector accounts for the EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides an indication of how much of the total factor income is reinvested in new fixed assets. Normally that ratio is about 20\u201323% of gross value-added. However, calling it the \"business investment rate\" or the \"gross investment rate\" is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to fixed investment, and more specifically, the net fixed investment (fixed assets bought, less disposals of fixed assets). The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in gross terms, are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than fixed assets only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying fixed assets is larger than the same sum netted of asset disposals. The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional fixed assets, which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, it is more likely that enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in fixed assets. In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion \u2013 if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.\nAbstract:\nThe text discusses the works of an author whose writings have a deeply spiritual nature. One of his works, called Vindiciae Pietatis, was initially refused a license by Archbishop Sheldon but was later published without it, along with other nonconformist books. The book quickly sold out and had a positive impact on society. The king's printer, Roger Norton, seized a large part of the first print run, intending to send it to the royal kitchen. However, upon reading the book, Norton decided it was too holy and valuable to destroy, so he bought back the sheets, bound them, and sold them in his own shop. Norton's actions were criticized, and he had to apologize before the council-table. The remaining copies of the book were then deemed to be \"bisked,\" which meant rubbing them with an inky brush and using them as kindling for fires in the kitchen. Some copies of the book still exist with this \"bisked\" appearance. Despite these challenges, the book was published again with additional content and earned a reputation. The author also published a book of sermons. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, credited this author as the originator of a prayer that Wesley introduced into Methodism in 1755.\nQuestions: Which paragraph corresponds to the abstract above?

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 17: The two PVA battalions attacking on the Marine right had their greatest success at Boulder City, seizing a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines. In an attempt to exploit this foothold, the PVA attacked the Berlin and East Berlin gates, passages through the wire that the Marines had used to supply and reinforce the two outposts before both were overwhelmed. Cloud cover prevented aerial observers from supporting the troops protecting the gates, and the PVA managed to gain control of Berlin gate and mount a second determined assault on the Boulder City perimeter. Hand-to-hand fighting raged all along the  of trench that Lieutenant Swigart's Marines still held. The company's ammunition ran low, and the plight of casualties became increasingly difficult as PVA fire killed two of Boulder City's eight corpsmen and wounded most of the others. By midnight, Swigart's company could muster no more than half its earlier strength, but it still clung to the rear slope of Boulder City. Casualties had further eroded the strength of the Boulder City garrison, when at 00:15 on the 25th, Company I, 3/1 Marines, moved toward the hill to reinforce Swigart's survivors. The PVA intercepted and correctly interpreted the coded radio message ordering the Company I Marines forward, thus obtaining information that enabled their artillery and mortars to wound or kill about a third of the reinforcements. Despite the deadly barrage, much of Company I reached Boulder City, joined forces with the remnants of Swigart's garrison, and took part in a counterattack that recaptured the hill by 03:30. Further reinforcements from Company E, 2/7 Marines, and Company E, 2/1 Marines, arrived by 05:30 to consolidate the position. A few PVA, however, continued to cling to positions on the slopes nearest the MLR. Since the PVA still controlled the approaches to Boulder City, they were able to mount another attack on that position at 08:20, 25 July. Fire from Marine mortars and artillery, and from the 90mm weapons of 10 tanks dug in on the Marine positions, played the key role in breaking up the new assault, although the last of the attackers did not withdraw until afternoon. The M-46 tanks proved deadly against advancing PVA troops, but also presented an inviting target for PVA artillery and mortar crews, who directed some 2,200 rounds at the armored vehicles. Aircraft also helped repulse the 25 July attack on Boulder City, as when F9F jets flew nine missions, guided by ground radar, against positions threatening Boulder City and nearby defensive strongpoints.\nAbstract:\nThe text describes the internal turmoil and political divisions in Milan, Italy during the 15th century.

        "question": "Below are one or more paragraph(s):\nParagraph 18: AGEP also differs from the other SCARs disorders in respect to the level of evidence supporting the underlying mechanism by which a drug or its metabolite stimulates CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Studies indicate that the mechanism by which a drug or its metabolites accomplishes this stimulation involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. A drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related epitope. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) takes up these proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the human leukocyte antigen (i.e. HLA) component of their major histocompatibility complex (i.e. MHC) (APC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the T-cell receptor on CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DM, HLA-DO, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, or HLA-DR proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to attack self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may also stimulate T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope, bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope, or bypass the APC by binding directly to a T cell receptor. However, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA serotypes to stimulate T cells and the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them. Since a SCARs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes, their ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or metabolite. Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop SCARs in response to a particular drug on the basis of their expression of HLA serotypes. Studies have identified several HLA serotypes associated with development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN in response to various drugs which elici these disorders, developed tests to identify individuals who express these serotypes, and thereby determined that these individuals should avoid the offending drug. HLA serotypes associated with AGEP and specific drugs have not been identified. A study conducted in 1995 identified of HLA-B51, HLA-DR11, and HLA-DQ3 of unknown serotypes to be associated with development of AGEP but the results have not been confirmed, expanded to identify the serotypes involved, nor therefore useful in identifying individuals predisposed to develop AGEP in response to any drug. Similarly, a specific T cell receptor variant has been associated with the development of DRESS syndrome, SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN but not AGEP.\nAbstract:\nThe text describes the internal turmoil and political divisions in Milan, Italy during the 15th century.
